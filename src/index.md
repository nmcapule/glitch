Technical jargon, programming language terms, and code samples are denoted with
the code class, as I’ve been using in this document to denote HTML. Code needs
to be monospace for formatting purposes and to aid in code analysis, but it must
maintain its readability. To those ends, Tufte CSS follows GitHub’s font selection,
which shifts gracefully along the monospace spectrum from the elegant but rare
Consolas all the way to good old reliable Courier.

Consolas all the way to good old reliable Courier. <span class="marginnote">I am a sidenote 2</span>
